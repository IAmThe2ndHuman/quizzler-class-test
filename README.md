# quizzler-class-test
A simple and basic "quiz" app I made in flutter to get familiar with classes, objects, and constructors in Dart.
## How to install (for Android Studio)
From the main menu of Android Studio select **Get from Version Control** (or something similar), then choose **Git** and paste in `https://github.com/IAmThe2ndHuman/quizzler-class-test.git`. Afterwards simply click **Clone**.

Android Studio will then ask you if you want to create an Android Studio project. **Click No.** Instead, choose open an existing Android Studio project, navigate to the folder that contains the project and open it.

Then run `flutter pub get` to get the dependencies required.

**Note: You will need to install the Flutter and Dart plugin first.**
